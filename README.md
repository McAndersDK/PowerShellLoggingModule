PowerShellLoggingModule
=======================
Uses Reflection to intercept text output headed for the PowerShell
console or ISE.  Lines of output are sent to any number of
subscriber objects for the purpose of producing complete log files
of script output (including date/timestamps) without the need for
extra code by the script author.
